## Getting Started

Before to start, it is important you to know that this library works with `minSdk = 26`.

To integrate the Compose Calendar library into your Android app, follow the next steps:

1. Add your MavenCentral and Jitpack to you `settings.gradle.kts` file

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        google {
            mavenContent {
                includeGroupAndSubgroups("androidx")
                includeGroupAndSubgroups("com.android")
                includeGroupAndSubgroups("com.google")
            }
        }
        mavenCentral()

        // üëá Aqu√≠ agregas jitpack
        maven(url = "https://jitpack.io") {
            content {
                includeGroupByRegex("com\\.github\\..*")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you are using an older versi√≥n of Android Studio, then add MavenCentral and Jitpack to your root
build.gradle file

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri(path = "https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```
2. Add the dependency in your project `libs.versions.toml` file

```
[versions]
composeCalendar = "{latest_version}"

[libraries]
compose-calendar = { module = "com.github.jimmyplazas:compose-calendar", version.ref = "composeCalendar" }
```

And then add the library to your `build.gradle.kts` file

```
implementation(libs.compose.calendar)
```

Replace the `{latest_version}`
with.  [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jimmyplazas/compose-calendar?label=ComposeCalendar&sort=semver)](https://github.com/jimmyplazas/compose-calendar/releases/latest)

## Documentation

**SimpleComposeCalendar**

SimpleComposeCalendar is a lightweight and easy-to-use Jetpack Compose calendar component that 
displays a monthly calendar view with simple event indicators. It supports customizable 
colors, navigation between months, and handles day clicks with associated events. This component 
is designed for straightforward integration when you need to display events on specific dates 
and allow user interaction with the calendar days.

```
@Composable
fun SimpleComposeCalendar(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    initDate: LocalDate = LocalDate.now().withDayOfMonth(1),
    events: List<SimpleCalendarEvent> = emptyList(),
    onDayClick: (date: LocalDate, events: List<SimpleCalendarEvent>) -> Unit = { _, _ -> },
    calendarColors: CalendarColors = CalendarDefaults.calendarColors(),
    firstDayOfWeek: DayOfWeek = WeekFields.of(Locale.getDefault()).firstDayOfWeek,
    isContentClickable: Boolean = true,
    onPreviousMonthClick: () -> Unit = {},
    onNextMonthClick: () -> Unit = {}
)
```

**Parameters**

- `modifier`: An optional parameter that allows you to apply styling or positioning to the 
 calendar component.
- `initDate`: Defines the initial date displayed in the calendar. By default, it shows the 
 first day of the current month. You can specify any date from which the calendar should start.
- `events`: A list of `SimpleCalendarEvent` objects representing the events to display on 
 the calendar. If no events are provided, the calendar initializes with an empty list.
- `onDayClick`: A callback function triggered when a day is clicked. It receives the 
 clicked `LocalDate` and a list of `SimpleCalendarEvent`s for that date. The list will be 
 empty if there are no events on the selected day.
- `calendarColors`: Allows customization of the calendar‚Äôs color scheme. If not specified, a default 
color set is applied.
- `firstDayOfWeek`: Specifies the first day of the week (e.g., `DayOfWeek.MONDAY`). By default, it
uses the locale‚Äôs first day.
- `isContentClickable`: Determines whether the calendar days are clickable. Defaults to `true`.
- `onPreviousMonthClick`: Callback invoked when navigating to the previous month.
- `onNextMonthClick`: Callback invoked when navigating to the next month.

**ComposeCalendar**

```
@Composable
fun <T> ComposeCalendar(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    initDate: LocalDate = LocalDate.now().withDayOfMonth(1),
    events: List<CalendarEvent<T>> = emptyList(),
    onDayClick: (date: LocalDate, events: List<CalendarEvent<T>>) -> Unit = { _, _ -> },
    calendarColors: CalendarColors = CalendarDefaults.calendarColors(),
    firstDayOfWeek: DayOfWeek = WeekFields.of(Locale.getDefault()).firstDayOfWeek,
    isContentClickable: Boolean = true,
    onPreviousMonthClick: () -> Unit = {},
    onNextMonthClick: () -> Unit = {}
)
```

**Parameters**

- `modifier`: An optional parameter that allows you to apply styling or positioning to the calendar
  component.
- `LocalDate`: This parameter defines the initial date displayed in the calendar. By default, it
  sets the calendar to show the current date. You can specify any date you want the calendar to
  start from.
- `events`: A list of CalendarEvent objects that represent the events to be displayed in the
  calendar. If no events are provided, the calendar will initialize with an empty list.
- `onDayClick`: A callback function that is triggered when a day is clicked in the calendar.
  The function receives a `LocalDate` representing the clicked day and a list of `CalendarEvents`
  associated with that date. The list will be empty if there are no events for the selected day.
- `calendarColors`: This allows you to customize the color scheme of the calendar. If not specified,
  it will use a default color set defined by the calendarColors() function.
- `firstDayOfWeek`: The first day of the week, e.g., `DayOfWeek.MONDAY`.
- `isContentClickable`: Whether the content area (days) of the calendar is clickable.
- `onPreviousMonthClick`: Callback invoked when the user navigates to the previous month.
- `onNextMonthClick:` Callback invoked when the user navigates to the next month.

**SimpleCalendarEvent**

`SimpleCalendarEvent` represents a basic event to be displayed on the calendar for a specific 
date. It includes an optional composable indicator that can be used to visually mark the 
event on the calendar day.

```
data class SimpleCalendarEvent(
    val date: LocalDate,
    val indicator: (@Composable () -> Unit)? = null
)
```

**Parameters**
- `date`: A `LocalDate` representing the date of the event.
- `indicator`: An optional composable lambda that renders a visual indicator for the event 
on the calendar day. If `null`, no indicator is shown.

**CalendarEvents**

The `CalendarEvent` class is a generic class that represents an event in the calendar.
Each event includes the date, an optional generic type that represents the data related with the
event and a composable function that will be used to show the indicator in the calendar.

```
data class CalendarEvent<T>(
    val data: T? = null,
    val date: LocalDate,
    val indicatorContent: (@Composable () -> Unit)? = null
)
```

**Parameters**

- `data`: Optional generic data of type `T` associated with the event. It can hold any relevant
 information related to the event.
- `date`: A `LocalDate` indicating the date on which the event occurs.
- `indicatorContent`: An optional composable lambda that renders a custom visual indicator for
 the event on the calendar day. If `null`, no indicator will be displayed.


## Example

```
ComposeCalendar(
    events = getListOfEvents(),
    calendarColors = calendarColors(
        eventBackgroundColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceContainerLow,
        eventContentColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onSurface
    ),
    onDayClick = { date, events -> 
        /* Do Something */ 
    },
    onPreviousMonthClick = { 
        /* Do Something */
    },
    onNextMonthClick = {  
        /* Do Something */
    }
)

private fun getListOfEvents() = listOf(
    CalendarEvent(
        data = MyData("Event 1"),
        date = java.time.LocalDate.now().plusDays(1),
        indicatorContent = { IndicatorContent() }
    ),
    CalendarEvent(
        data = MyData("Event 2"),
        date = java.time.LocalDate.now().plusDays(1),
        indicatorContent = { IndicatorContent(Color.Red) }
    ),
    CalendarEvent(
        data = MyData("Event 3"),
        date = java.time.LocalDate.now().plusDays(1),
        indicatorContent = { IndicatorContent() }
    ),
    CalendarEvent(
        data = MyData("Event 4"),
        date = java.time.LocalDate.now().plusDays(1),
        indicatorContent = { IndicatorContent() }
    ),
    CalendarEvent(
        data = MyData("Event 4"),
        date = java.time.LocalDate.now().plusDays(5),
        indicatorContent = { IndicatorContent() }
    ),
)
```
