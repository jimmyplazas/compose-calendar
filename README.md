A simple, customizable and easy-to-use calendar component built entirely with Jetpack Compose.
Designed to fit seamlessly into modern Android applications, this library offers a flexible
interface for displaying calendar events focused on simplicity and material design principles.

- **Easy to Use**: Simple integration into your application.
- **Customizable**: Modify the style and functionality to suit your needs.

## Getting Started

Before to start, it is important you to know that this library works with `minSdk = 26`.

To integrate the Compose Calendar library into your Android app, follow the next steps:

1. Add your MavenCentral and Jitpack to you `settings.gradle.kts` file

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        google {
            mavenContent {
                includeGroupAndSubgroups("androidx")
                includeGroupAndSubgroups("com.android")
                includeGroupAndSubgroups("com.google")
            }
        }
        mavenCentral()

        // üëá Aqu√≠ agregas jitpack
        maven(url = "https://jitpack.io") {
            content {
                includeGroupByRegex("com\\.github\\..*")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

If you are using an older versi√≥n of Android Studio, then add MavenCentral and Jitpack to your root
build.gradle file

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri(path = "https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}
```

2. Add the dependency in your project `libs.versions.toml` file

```
[versions]
kotlinxDatetime = "0.6.0"
composeCalendar = "{latest_version}"

[libraries]
kotlinx-datetime = { module = "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-datetime", version.ref = "kotlinxDatetime" }
compose-calendar = { module = "com.github.jimmyale3102:compose-calendar", version.ref = "composeCalendar" }
```

And then add the library to your `build.gradle.kts` file

```
implementation(libs.compose.calendar)
```

Replace the `{latest_version}`
with.  [![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jimmyplazas/compose-calendar?label=ComposeCalendar&sort=semver)](https://github.com/jimmyplazas/compose-calendar/releases/latest)

## Documentation

```
@Composable
fun ComposeCalendar(
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
    initDate: LocalDate = Clock.System.now()
        .toLocalDateTime(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault())
        .date.toInitDate(),
    events: List<CalendarEvent> = emptyList(),
    onDayClick: (date: LocalDate, events: List<CalendarEvent>) -> Unit = { _, _ -> },
    calendarColors: CalendarColors = CalendarDefaults.calendarColors(),
    animatedBody: Boolean = true,
    onPreviousMonthClick: () -> Unit = {},
    onNextMonthClick: () -> Unit = {}
)
```

**Parameters**

- `modifier`: An optional parameter that allows you to apply styling or positioning to the calendar
  component.
- `LocalDate`: This parameter defines the initial date displayed in the calendar. By default, it
  sets the calendar to show the current date. You can specify any date you want the calendar to
  start from.
- `events`: A list of CalendarEvent objects that represent the events to be displayed in the
  calendar. If no events are provided, the calendar will initialize with an empty list.
- `onDayClick`: A callback function that is triggered when a day is clicked in the calendar.
  The function receives a LocalDate representing the clicked day and a list of CalendarEvents
  associated with that date. The list will be empty if there are no events for the selected day.
- `calendarColors`: This allows you to customize the color scheme of the calendar. If not specified,
  it will use a default color set defined by the calendarColors() function.
- `animatedBody`: Whether the body of the calendar (days grid) should animate during month transitions.
- `onPreviousMonthClick`: Callback invoked when the user navigates to the previous month.
- `onNextMonthClick:` Callback invoked when the user navigates to the next month.

**CalendarEvents**

The `CalendarEvent` class represents an event in the calendar. Each event includes information like
the title, optional description, date, and an associated icon.

```
data class CalendarEvent(
    val title: String? = null,
    val description: String? = null,
    val date: LocalDate,
    val icon: ImageVector? = null
)
```

## Example

```
ComposeCalendar(
    events = listOf(
        CalendarEvent(
            title = "Event 1",
            date = Clock.System.now()
                .toLocalDateTime(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault()).date,
            description = "Description 1",
            icon = Icons.Default.Star
        )
    ),
    calendarColors = calendarColors(
        eventBackgroundColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.surfaceContainerLow,
        eventContentColor = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.onSurface
    ),
    onDayClick = { date, events -> 
        /* Do Something */ 
    },
    onPreviousMonthClick = { 
        /* Do Something */
    },
    onNextMonthClick = {  
        /* Do Something */
    }
)
```
